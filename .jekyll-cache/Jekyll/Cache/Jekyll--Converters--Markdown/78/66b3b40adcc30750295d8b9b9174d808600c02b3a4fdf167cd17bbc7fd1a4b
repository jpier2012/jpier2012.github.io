I"-<p>Welp, I officially feel like a software engineer.</p>

<p>As we enter into our 2nd project next week, a Sinatra CRUD application, I am extremely eager to display my new skills. In my experience, project assignments are the best way for me to solidify my knowledge of material, as the open-ended nature of the problem inspires me to really get my hands dirty by trying new things to challenge myself. There are no tests to pass, only best practices to follow, and the sky is the limit.</p>

<p>I just want to take a moment to reflect on some advice that I’ve received consistently throughout my programming journey, not just through Flatiron, but also during my entire 6+ years spent in technical roles at an internet company -</p>

<p>“Hard skills make developers, and soft skills break them.”</p>

<p><em>For those unaware: “Soft Skills” are essentially people skills, including communcation, compassion, understanding, patience, approachability, etc</em></p>

<p>The reality is that, as a software engineer/computer programmer/developer/IT Wizard/etc, an enormous challenge of your job is not only building, repairing, and maintaining technology, it’s <em>working with other people to build, repair, and maintain technology.</em> To build complex software systems via Agile methodology takes large-scale coordination and tight working relationships between teammates. Unless you are a one-man-show at a small company or startup, where you make 100% of tech decisions and answer to no-one, you’re going to have to discuss your work with others, oftentimes your superiors, maybe even in front of a crowd. It’s likely your audience will be ignorant to the challenges and caveats of your day-to-day, and may, literally, not speak the same coding language that you do. It’s not their fault! You were hired for a reason, and that’s because they can’t do your job.</p>

<p>So, it is absolutely <em>paramount</em> that you, as a developer, are able to clearly and concisely communicate your work to others, which includes being mindful of not just <em>what</em> you say, but <em>how</em> you say it.</p>

<p>This is obviously the case when working with other developers directly, especially cooperatively in real-time or during  technical disagreements, however, this also extends to several other contexts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You’ll often need to set expectations with management regarding how long a particular task may take, or what resources (= <script type="math/tex">) will be required for completion. This may require negotiation or persuasion to make sure that you're given as much time (or</script>) as you need to complete a task, while management understands that you are doing as much as you possible can to hit that deadline (or budget), given the challenges you have in front of you (that are written in a language your boss doesn’t understand).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you’re ever part of a cross-functional team working with other departments, you may have to discuss the high-level aspects of your work while abstracting away the messy details. Essentially, you have to <em>think about your work as it relates to other departments</em>, and this can be very tough to do, especially when you’ve spent the past several days neck-deep in code on the hunt for a particularly elusive bug.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Last but not least, every technical interview is going to be a low-key display of soft skills, so it’s important that you let the best parts of your personality shine through at each opportunity. Be curious. Be enthusiastic. Ask specific, drilling questions that show you’ve done your research and are genuinely intrigued by what you found. Use humor where appropriate. Regardless of how talented you are in the technical realm, you’re still working for an organization run by human beings, which means you need to understand, appreciate, and gel with them just as much as the software you write.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I feel that the most challenging part of this bootcamp comes from our project technical interviews, which is what inspired this post. Discussing code using with proper terminology, while not stumbling through each sentence or relying on filler words to break the silence, can be nerve-wracking, but I feel that with some more practice I’ll be 100% confident by the time I start my job search.</p>
