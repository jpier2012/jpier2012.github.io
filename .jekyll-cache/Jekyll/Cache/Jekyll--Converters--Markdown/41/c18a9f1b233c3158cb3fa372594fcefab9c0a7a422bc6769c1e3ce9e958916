I"f<p>With only a handful of weeks left at Flatiron, I’ve found myself feeling bittersweet about graduation. It’s already been 4 months since my first lecture back in April and I’m now facing the reality that I’ll be “officially” looking for a job soon. 4 projects down, only 1 to go, with React being the final step in the development process.</p>
