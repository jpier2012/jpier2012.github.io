I"Í<p>Welp, that‚Äôs it. I‚Äôve done it. I just submitted my final project and walkthrough video. Once I pass my final assessment, I‚Äôll officially be looking for a job as a Flatiron grad.</p>

<p>Real talk: At this point in my career, working with React is not my favorite. The philosophies behind React‚Äôs construction make 100% sense to me but it still feels clunky and counterintuitive to work with. However, as I continue to work with it, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll feel more ‚Äúnatural‚Äù as time goes on.</p>

<p>Regardless, in order to keep my skills sharp (especially React), I‚Äôm going to need to not only stay busy, but stay challenged. In order to achieve this, I‚Äôm first going to buy a whiteboard, and then use it to maintain inventory of all the things I have to work on.</p>

<p>Right out of the gate, here‚Äôs what I have so far, in loose order of priority:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Add a Bootstrap(-React) front end to JimJobs, my final project</li>
  <li>Host my apps on Heroku (FoodView2, JimJobs, MisterFitness)</li>
  <li>Redo FoodView2 and MisterFitness front ends in bootstrap</li>
  <li>Add more JimJobs features, e.g. ability to delete objects, show contacts that haven‚Äôt been contacted in 7 days, etc</li>
</ol>

<p>While those projects will be fun, and most certainly rewarding, I feel I should also pursue more challenge in the form of open source project contributions and Leetcode/Firecode exercises. I will be setting aside a portion of each day to work on those materials specifically, vs. fun personal projects.</p>

<p>I will also be learning data structures and algorithms via a Udemy class, which should be interesting!</p>

<p>This blog will continue to serve as documentation for my journey.</p>

<p>Farewell, until next time!</p>

<p>James</p>
