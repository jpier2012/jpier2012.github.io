I"Z<p>In case the title didn’t properly describe my enthusiasm, I’m a big fan of partials! They’re a great way to simplify views and can be used in ways you might not expect, given the fact that you can pass local variables to them. So, I’d like to share a couple of ways I’ve used them to my advantage in my recent project, FoodView.</p>
