Welp, that's it. I've done it. I just submitted my final project and walkthrough video. Once I pass my final assessment, I'll officially be looking for a job as a Flatiron grad.

Real talk: At this point in my career, working with React is not my favorite. The philosophies behind React's construction make 100% sense to me but it still feels clunky and counterintuitive to work with. However, as I continue to work with it, I'm sure it'll feel more "natural" as time goes on.

Regardless, in order to keep my skills sharp (especially React), I'm going to need to not only stay busy, but stay challenged. In order to achieve this, I'm first going to buy a whiteboard, and then use it to maintain inventory of all the things I have to work on.

Right out of the gate, here's what I have so far, in loose order of priority:

1. Add a Bootstrap(-React) front end to JimJobs, my final project
2. Host my apps on Heroku (FoodView2, JimJobs, MisterFitness)
3. Redo FoodView2 and MisterFitness front ends in bootstrap
4. Add more JimJobs features, e.g. ability to delete objects, show contacts that haven't been contacted in 7 days, etc

While those projects will be fun, and most certainly rewarding, I feel I should also pursue more challenge in the form of open source project contributions and Leetcode/Firecode exercises. I will be setting aside a portion of each day to work on those materials specifically, vs. fun personal projects.

I will also be learning data structures and algorithms via a Udemy class, which should be interesting!

This blog will continue to serve as documentation for my journey.

Farewell, until next time!

James
