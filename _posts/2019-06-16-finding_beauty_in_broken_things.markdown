After completing the Mister Fitness project (https://github.com/jpier2012/mister_fitness), I've begun to realize that my passion for development rests heavily on a ubiquitous yet elusive force: inspiration.

Inspiration is the difference between work and play, peaks and plateaus, the ordinary vs. extraordinary. It is a crucial foundation to all that man has built, and yet is vividly abstract and intangible; hard to describe, but easy to identify.

For me, inspiration seems to come naturally when I'm faced with the right challenge - a fairly ambiguous task with just enough direction to show me a clear starting point, but also pushing me to play, experiment, break things and then fix them again. 

It wasn't very difficult for me to meet the minimum requirements of the project, in fact, quite the opposite; I found it extremely difficult to set a stopping point for myself because I kept falling victim to (my new favorite phrase) "feature creeping", the constant yearning for more functionality despite a looming deadline drawing nearer.

I also, once again, witnessed the importance of staying on task when starting a project. It's easy to get lost in the details when faced with an equal-parts-exciting-and-overwhelming project, so its best to start with first creating required files, then stubbing out as many methods as possible. Once you have a list of tasks in front of you, it's all plugging and chugging, and no analysis paralysis.

Ultimately, even though programming can be incredibly frustrating - after all, your job revolves around making broken things work - it's also incredibly rewarding. As I learn more and more about Ruby, Rails, and web development in general, my curiosity continues to grow, and I grow more eager to develop my professional skils.

I can't wait to see what's next!
