With only 4 weeks left at Flatiron, I've found myself feeling bittersweet about graduation. It's already been 4 months since my first lecture back in April and I'm now facing the reality that I'll be "officially" looking for a job soon. 4 projects down, only 1 to go, with React being the final step in the development process.

I'm content with the idea that I'll be working with JavaScript, Ruby, Rails, React, or all of the above for the next several years.

But, the software development industry is ever-changing! Inevitably, the development demands of the modern world will shift as technology continues to advance. So, I'm certainly not worried about my newfound skills becoming obsolete anytime soon, however, I can't help but wonder what the next step will be once I've gotten some experience under my belt.

Below are a few languages that have piqued my interest -

* Python

It seems like you can do pretty much anything with Python - from data science, to web scraping, to online gaming, Python has been compared to Ruby in its readability and elegance, but with some added horsepower for large scale number crunching.

Python is consistently listed as one of the top programming languages in the world, year over year, on multiple indexes (just Google "top programming languages" for countless lists). In Stack Overflow's 2018 survey, Python listed 7th, but this was below JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL (which are typically used in conjunction for web dev); Java, which is distributed by Oracle and used in literally countless devices and applications; and bash/shell scripting, which is likely used to support the development of other applications but not used for production itself (my best guess). 

I think it's safe to say Python will be around for many years to come, and it's prevalence will only continue to increase.

* Go(Lang):

This was designed by Google developers to be static-typed and run efficiently like C++, be readable and useable like Python or JavaScript, and be capable of high-performance networking and processing. Per https://golang.org/, "Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software." 

I like the sound of that! 

Go was first used within the past 10 years and so is fairly fresh on the scene. It primarily appeals to me because 1) I like the idea of getting closer to the underlying machinery that powers the web, and 2) newer languages are typically easier to work with than older ones. As I build experience in WebDev, I can only hope to find an application for Go in the future!

* Haskell

There is one comment on Haskell that I've seen, consistently, in every discussion I've read - "it will change the way you think about programming". 

Purely functional, statically typed and lazily-evaluated, it even *sounds* interesting to work with. Haskell has countless applications across various industries, but the reason it's not more widespread is due to the steep learning curve - per the HuffingtonPost, "Haskellâ€™s commercial adoption has been held back by its reputation for being hard to learn, an open-source toolchain that is time consuming to assemble, and lack of a commercial vendor to push for its adoption."

However, it also has a reputation for building very clean, efficient, reliable software, which make it well worth the effort to learn. I'm a long way away from trying to take on a new language at this point in my learning, but I'm keeping Haskell right in my back pocket for when I'm ready for a new pair of shoes.

-

In short, I'm excited to have a career that involves continuous learning. It's only a matter of time before I get comfortable enough with JS and Ruby that I'll feel the desire to explore more languages. I feel that it's important to strike a balance between specialization and generalization, and it never hurts to know what you're missing by exploring a language you wouldn't otherwise use in your day-to-day.
