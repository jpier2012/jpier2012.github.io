After graduating with a dual bachelors in Psychology and Sociology in 2012, I found myself thrust into the real world with far more questions than answers.

"What now?"
"Do I want to further my education?"
"What do I want out of my career?"
"What do I want out of life?"

Without knowing how to satisfy my inquiries, and also needing money to live, I decided it was best to find a job and earn some work experience before planning my next move.

Long story short, in the course of ~6 years I went from Customer Care Specialist, to Account Manager, to Sales Reporting Analyst, to Senior Data Quality Analyst within the same company. This was due to a combination of hard work, persistence, resourcefulness, and lots of luck, considering I never received any formal education or training in anything data or tech related. 

Through this career progression, I discovered 2 things firsthand:

1) I love working with technology, and I don't want to stop working with people.
2) I love building technology for other people to use.

Put in the context of my work experience, the last few years of my career were spent building complicated Excel workbooks to process or summarize massive spreadsheets of data. These workbooks were often used by other members of my team, so anytime I designed a workbook for my own purposes, I was ultimately designing it for other people as well.

This was inspiring to me. It caused me to think about construction and design in terms of long-term scalability and sustainability, rather than short-term utility - I had no idea who would be using my work in the future, but I'd need to make sure they understood it. When business rules change, they need to be readily translated into reporting processes. Thus, I learned to build Excel workbooks as if they were self-contained software programs; I had to think not in terms of what makes sense to *me*, but what makes sense to *users in general*, and how I can *change* the function of the workbook to match the demands of the business. 

Alas, software development seems to be the next logical step in my career progression, which is what has brought me to Flatiron School. Programming is an exciting new challenge built upon my existing experience, it satisfies both my creative compulsion and passion for problem solving, and, if nothing else, it'll allow me to work on cool, practical applications!

My biggest question now is, "what do I want to do with this?"

Well, what *don't* I want to do as a programmer in the next 30+ years? Off the very top of my head, here are a few paths that seem worth exploring:

- Leverage my existing experience as an analyst to build data analysis software
- Design CRM software to facilitate sales operations
- Build apps for healthcare or social work
- Teach programming, maybe even in developing countries
- Become a consultant and do all of the above!

As to where I end up, only time will tell. I just know that it's going to be an exciting journey and I can't wait to see what's next!
