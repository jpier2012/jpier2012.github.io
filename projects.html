  JimJobs allows you to document your job search journey through objects for Companies, Contacts, and Positions. From the main dashboard page, use the forms to enter in information and see it reflected in realtime. Visit the
  corresponding index page for each model to see everything you've submitted.

  Short, sweet, and straight to the point.

  This is my fourth and final project as a Flatiron School student.

With FoodView2, you finally have a legitimate reason to post pictures of your food on the internet. You can
rate each dish you create and also see Dishes created by other people. You can also add your own restaurants, or use
those created by others. This include all the awesomeness of the original FoodView, but with asynchronous JS functions incuded. The restaurant
index and show pages have been converted into one all-encompassing Restaurants page, but otherwise it's the same app.

  This is my third project as a Flatiron School student.

  With MisterFitness you can log your workouts online to keep track of your athletic progress over time. You can also
  share your workouts with your friends to add some friendly competition! MisterFitness even makes it easy to duplicate a
  friend's workout for an added convenience. Each workout is composed of exercises that are created from scratch or cloned
  from existing exercises.

  This is my second project as a Flatiron School student.
