<p>
  After spending 6 years working at an internet company, starting in client-facing tech support and clawing my way up and over into reporting analysis and data quality, I learned how to instruct Microsft Excel to do my job for me in the form of complex formulas and VBA scripts. After that, I knew it was my destiny to be an instructor of modern machinery, a keyboard jockey, a liasion between technology and the non-technical. Combined with a dual bachelors in social sciences from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, I have an immense appreciation for the goals of modern technology - to extend and enhance the capabilities of humans, most often by shifting computational burden from man to machine. E.g. use Facebook to remember your friends' birthdays so that you don't have to.
